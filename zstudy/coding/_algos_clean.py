https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/
  
      Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. 
      Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

    Implement KthLargest class:

    KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
    int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.


    Example 1:

    Input
    ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
    [[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
    k=3 
    Output
    [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]

    Explanation
    KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3,    [4, 5, 8, 2]);

    kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4   because  8,5,4      3th largest  from [4, 5, 8, 2]  + [3]     8,    
    kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5   becaues  8,5,5       
    kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5  
    kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8
    kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8


    Constraints:

    1 <= k <= 104
    0 <= nums.length <= 104
    -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
    -104 <= val <= 104
    At most 104 calls will be made to add.
    It is guaranteed that there will be at least k elements in the array when you search for the kth element.

        
        Similar to Problems 0973 K Closest Points to Origin and 0215 Kth Largest Element in an Array with exactly the same idea:
        here we heap min-heap with k biggest elements, then k-th largest element will be in the root of our heap.
        When we have new element we check if it is more than root of our heap, then we put this element to heap and remove smallest element from heap, so we will always keep it k elements.

        Complexity
        It is O(k + (n-k)*log k) for init and O(log k) for add. Space complexity is O(k).


        heap structure ???

        
            A heap is a data structure, in sorted    increasing heap or descr heap.  
                push      :         insert in correct order.
                findMax/findMin :   Finds the largest or smallest vales ( depending on increasing heap OR descresing heap ). 
                deletMax/deleteMin: Delets Min/max value. 
                heappushpop   == GetMax + deleteMax  (in  incr. heap ) 
                        
            heap == stream ordered  : receive elt and put it in correct sorted location
            
                
        #### Code
        class KthLargest:
            def __init__(self, k, nums):
                self.heap = nums[:k]  ##init
                heapify(self.heap)  ### sorted array
                self.k = k
                for num in nums[k:]:   ### activate the stream
                    if num > self.heap[0]:  ###  hepa[0] is min,,, heap[-1] is max
                        ### push new value, and Remove the smalleest
                        ### size is kept ==  K                 
                        heappushpop(self.heap, num)   ###push it and replace the min value.
                        
            def add(self, val) :
                if len(self.heap) < self.k:
                    heappush(self.heap, val)  ### push new value , smaller
                    
                elif val > self.heap[0]:
                    heappushpop(self.heap, val)   ### do same before
                    
                ### heap[0] = min    <>   heap == k-largest because len(heap) >= k :    
                
                ### construction of the HEAP --->   Min == K-largest  (True by construction of the heap with headpushpop)
                #### remove min, keep higher value.
                return self.heap[0]     ### k-
            
            [4, 5, 8, 2]  + [3]   -->   [4, 5, 8 ]     2 < 4 :  discard 2,   3 < 4 : discard,  keep 4   
            
            
        heap : sorted array 
        Constructu heap to ensure than  heap[0] == min == K-largest  (ie compare heap[0] with new value)

        
        

        #### idea :
        heap : head[0] = min == k-largest element  , heap size k 
        build the heap to ensure heap[0] == k-largest
        heappushpop(heap1, val)  ## val > min


        def init():
            heap = heapify(v[:k])
            n = len(v)
            for i in range(k, n):
                if v[i] > heap[0]:
                    heappushpop(heap, v[i])  ### v[i] is inserted to replace the min
                else :    
                    pass
        
        def add(x):
            if len(heap) < k :

      Valid Palindrome II
      Easy
      Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.



      Example 1:

        Input: s = "aba"
        Output: true
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "abca"
        Output: true
        Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
          
      Example 3:
        Input: s = "abc"
        Output: false


      Constraints:

          1 <= s.length <= 105
          s consists of lowercase English letters.


      What we need to do is to start to traverse our string from both sides and if elements are equal, we are OK,
      we need to take both (we can not remove both, because we allowed only delete one. 
     There are couple of tricks we can use: all(...) to check if all elements in list are True. 

    Also s[~i] will give you i-th element from the end: we traverse our string and if we have different symbols on some step, 
    we check two options: substring s[i+1:j] and s[i:j-1].

    Complexity
    It is O(n) for time and O(1) for space.


    if not equal:
       remove the right character and check again if not 
            remove the left chacrter and check again if not 
                                    return False 

    def check(s: str) :         
          for i in range(len(s) // 2): 
                if s[i] != s[~i]:
                     return False 

          return True 


    def solution(s: str) -> bool: 
        for i in range(len(s) // 2): 
             if s[i] != s[~i]: 
                  tmp1 = tmp2 = s
                  tmp1.remove(i)   ### remove current
                  tmp2.remove(len(s) - i - 1)  #### remove symmetric
                  return check(tmp1) or check(tmp2)   #### check one of the 2 cases

        return True

      410. Split Array Largest Sum
      Hard
      Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, 
          you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.

      Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

      Example 1:
          Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
          Output: 18
          Explanation:
          There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
                            
      The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
      where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
                            
      Example 2:
          Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
          Output: 9
          Example 3:

      Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
      Output: 4


      Constraints:

      1 <= nums.length <= 1000
      0 <= nums[i] <= 106
      1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)

                            
        Solution 1
            One way is to use binary search for Q: check 
                if we can split numbers into m groups such that the largest sum <= Q. We do it in greedy way.

                                    
        Complexity
        Time complexity of this approach is O(n * log(SUM)), where SUM is sum of all numbers in array. Space complexity is O(1).

        Q: is the value which is the largest sum should be less than Q, we are doing binary search on Q      
            "Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays."
                                    
                    Minimize  some largest value  ---> we to take intermediate value V and minimize V.

        844. Backspace String Compare
        Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

        Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

        
        Example 1:
            Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
            Output: true
            Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

            
        Example 2:
            Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
            Output: true
            Explanation: Both s and t become "".

        Example 3:
            Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
            Output: false
            Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
        

        Constraints:
            1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
            s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

            Follow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?                        

            O(n + m) time and space solution is straightforward: use stack and imitate process.

            If we want to do it in O(1) space, we need to go from the end of string, because if we go from the beginning we do not know in advance if symbol will be erased or not. Let i, j be indexes for the first and the second string and backS, backT be counter how many symbols we need to erase. We iterate over both strings until we need to remove symbols and then compare symbols.

 560. Subarray Sum Equals K
    Medium
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
    A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
        Output: 2
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
        Output: 2


    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    -107 <= k <= 107
    Accepted
    785,933
    Subm                       



     Evaluate cumulative sums and then for each cumulative sum si check if we already have si - k in
      our dictionary and how many times. If we do not found it, just increase frequency by one. Be careful, we need to traverse cumulative sums one by one, we can not just evaluate frequencies, in this way we can have both k and -k subarrays.

    Complexity
    Time and space complexity is O(n).

    Code
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
            acc = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
            count = 0
            d = defaultdict(int)
            for i in acc:
                if (i-k) in d:
                    count += d[i-k] 
                d[i] += 1
            return count                       

		
        
        left = 0 
        for i2 in range(0,n):
                       
           if ssum == k :
              cnt  = cnt+1
           elif ssum < K :
               ssum =  ssum + A[i2]               
            
           elif ssum > K :
               while ssum > K and left < i2:
                  ssum =  ssum - A[left]
                  left += 1 
        
        
        ssum : continuously increase, decrease.

Swapping pairs make sum equal 
        Easy Accuracy: 41.35% Submissions: 19608 Points: 2
        Given two arrays of integers A[] and B[] of size N and M, the task is to check 
        if a pair of values (one value from each array) exists such that swapping the elements 
        of the pair will make the sum of two arrays equal.

        

        Example 1:
            Input: N = 6, M = 4
            A[] = {4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2}
            B[] = (3, 6, 3, 3)
            
            Output: 1
            Explanation: Sum of elements in A[] = 11
            Sum of elements in B[] = 15, To get same 
            sum from both arrays, we can swap following 
            values: 1 from A[] and 3 from B[]

            
        Example 2:

            Input: N = 4, M = 4
            A[] = {5, 7, 4, 6}
            B[] = {1, 2, 3, 8}
            Output: 1
            Explanation: We can swap 6 from array 
            A[] and 2 from array B[]




        Method 4 (Hashing) 
            We can solve this problem in O(m+n) time and O(m) auxiliary space. 

        
        m = len(array1)
        n = len(array2)
        
        # Find sum1 and sum2   
        sum1 = sum(array1)
        sum2 = sum(array2)
        
        # Now, lets make the hashset for array1
        set1 = {}
        for x in array1:
            set1.insert(x)
        
        # The key idea :
        # We want to chose elements in array1 and array2 such that their difference is (sum1-sum2)/2
        # Swapping them would make the array sums equal
        ## are you here ????
        
        diff= (sum1-sum2)/2
        for i in range(0, n):
            
            ### dont understand this condition, 
            ### Cool let me explain it 
            if array2[i]+diff in set1:
            print(array2[i]+diff,  array2[i]  )
            flag = True
            break
        
            ### The main idea is to find 2 elements say x in array1 and y in array2 such that swapping would make sums equal
            ### sum1_new = sum1 + y - x
            ### sum2_new = sum2 + x - y
            
            ### We need the sum1_new and sum2_new to be equal right so,
            ### sum1_new 

            OK, I understand NOW, BUT how to get this idea ???
            Is it a standard pattern ?
            
            ### Say sum1 > sum2 , intutively u would want to chose a larger element from array1 and a smaller from array2 and swap right ?

            
        x1-y2 = (sum1-sum2)/2
        
        sum1_new = sum1 -x1 + y2 = sum1 - (sum1-sum2)/2
        sum2_new = sum2 -y2 + x1 = sum2 + (sum1-sum2)/2
        
        ### it';s just the  math condition  ( Right )
        sum1_new = sum2_new
        sum1 -x1 + y2  =  sum2 -y2 + x1
        sum1-sum2 =    2*(x1-y2)
        x1-y2 = (sum1-sum2)/2
        
        for x1 in array1:
            if x1+ diff0 in set_array2 :
            then OK works.   ## hash == O(1)  
        
            ### USe a hash to have O(1)
        No need to say stupid remark on hash, 
            oviously we dont build the hash map n times.... (cool)
            
            This OK, it's directly yhe MATH condition + Hash

        Correct !!!
            OK, lets move to next problem and skip the stupid solution.
        ( The majority element one right ??? )
        
        
        ### Invariant  is  (sum1-sum2)/2
        ####
        
        yes, we just implement the description below  
        // assume array1 is small i.e. (m < n)
        // where m is array1.length and n is array2.length

        1. Find sum1(sum of small array elements) ans sum2

        (sum of larger array elements). // time O(m+n)

        2. Make a hashset for small array(here array1).

        3. Calculate diff as (sum1-sum2)/2.

        4. Run a loop for array2

            for (int i equal to 0 to n-1)

            if (hashset contains (array2[i]+diff))

                print array2[i]+diff and array2[i]

                set flag  and break;

        5. If flag is unset then there is no such kind of 

        pair.

Majority Element 
        Medium Accuracy: 48.6% Submissions: 100k+ Points: 4
        Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. 
        A majority element in an array A of size N is 
        an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.
    
    Example 1:
        Input:
        N = 3 
        A[] = {1,2,3} 
        Output:
        -1
        Explanation:
        Since, each element in 
        {1,2,3} appears only once so there 
        is no majority element.
        
    
    Example 2:
        Input:
        N = 5 
        A[] = {3,1,3,3,2} 
        Output:
        3
        Explanation:
        Since, 3 is present more
        than N/2 times, so it is 
        the majority element


    METHOD 4 (Using Hashmap): 


    Approach: This method is somewhat similar to Moore voting algorithm 
    in terms of time complexity, but in this case,
    there is no need for the second step of Moore voting algorithm. 
    But as usual, here space complexity becomes O(n). 
    In Hashmap(key-value pair), at value, maintain a count for each element(key) and whenever the count is greater than half of the array length, return that key(majority element). 
    
    
    Algorithm:
        Create a hashmap to store a key-value pair, i.e. element-frequency pair.
        Traverse the array from start to end.
        For every element in the array, insert the element in the hashmap 
        if the element does not exist as key, else fetch the value of the key ( array[i] ), 
        and increase the value by 1
        
        If the count is greater than half then print the majority element and break.
        If no majority element is found print "No Majority element"

        is very easy
        
        ddict = {}
        for x in range(array1):
        if x not in ddict : ddict[x]=1
        else: ddict[x] +=1 
        
        for key,val in ddict.items():
        if val > n//2 : return key
        return -1
    
    no, it was vrey easy, usually hashmap are very easy.
    
    let move to next ( COOL )
        ( Yeah this is correct )
        ( So is there any doubt ??? )
    Should I use hashmaps or the moore voting algo ???

    hashmap is MORE generic solution, 

    Cool will explain that just that moore is better in terms of space ( Its O(1))

    ctr_map = {}
    for x in array:
    if x not in ctr_map:
        ctr_map[x] = 1
    else:

    # element in an array 

    def findMajority(arr, size):
        m = {}
        for i in range(size):
            if arr[i] in m:

            else:
                m[arr[i]] = 1
        count = 0
        for key in m:
            if m[key] > size / 2:
                count = 1
                print("Majority found :-",key)
                break

Find Missing And Repeating 

    Medium Accuracy: 37.77% Submissions: 100k+ Points: 4
    Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers.
    One number 'A' from set {1, 2, …N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. 
    Find these two numbers.

    Example 1:
        Input:
        N = 2
        Arr[] = {2, 2}
        Output: 2 1
        Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
        smallest positive missing number is 1.

    Example 2:
        Input:
        N = 3
        Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
        Output: 3 2
        Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
        smallest positive missing number is 2.

    Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
    Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)




    ################################################################################
    Method 6 (Use a Map)
        Approach: 
        This method involves creating a Hashtable with the help of Map. 
        In this, the elements are mapped to their natural index. 
        In this process, if an element is mapped twice, then it is the repeating element. 
        And if an element's mapping is not there, then it is the missing element.

    n = len(array)
    ctr_map = {}
    for x in array:
    if x not in ctr_map:
        ctr_map[x] = 1
    else:
        ctr_map[x] += 1
    
    missing_ele, duplicate_ele = -1, -1
    for key in range(1,n+1):
    if(key not in ctr_map):
        missing_ele = key
    elif(ctr_map[key]==2):
        duplicate_ele = key
    else:
        pass

    ### Is this fine ???
    yes, ahashmap is trivial, direcy solution

    ### Should I explain an alternate with O(1) space ???
    No need,

Median in a stream of integers (running integers)
        Difficulty Level : Hard
        Last Updated : 28 Mar, 2022
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/
            
            
        Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so 
        for in an efficient way. For simplicity assume, there are no duplicates. 
        For example, let us consider the stream 5, 15, 1, 3 … 


        After reading 1st element of stream - 5 -> median - 5
        After reading 2nd element of stream - 5, 15 -> median - 10
        After reading 3rd element of stream - 5, 15, 1 -> median - 5
        After reading 4th element of stream - 5, 15, 1, 3 -> median - 4, so on...
        Making it clear, when the input size is odd, we take the middle element of sorted data. 
        If the input size is even, we pick the average of the middle two elements in the sorted stream.
        Note that output is the effective median of integers read from the stream so far. 
        Such an algorithm is called an online algorithm. 
        Any algorithm that can guarantee the output of i-elements after processing i-th element, 
        is said to be online algorithm. Let us discuss three solutions to the above problem.



    

    Time Complexity: If we omit the way how stream was read, complexity of median finding is O(N log N), 
    as we need to read the stream, and due to heap insertions/deletions.

    Auxiliary Space: O(N)
    At first glance the above code may look complex. If you read the code carefully, it is simple algorithm.   

    # Heap based
    ### Key idea :
        Maintain 2 heaps ( A left heap & aa right heap )

        Left Right 
    # Condition : Left <= RIght & (Right - Left) <=1  
                Left = Right     (Even)
            OR   Left = Right-1   (Odd)

    A= [5, 15, 1, 3, 2, 8, 7, 9, 10, 6, 11, 4]

    Left -> [] Right -> [5]
    Left -> [5] Right -> [15]
    Left -> [1] Right -> [5,15] =>    ## why 5 is needed in [5,15]

    Left -> [3] Right -> [  ] =>    ##

    for i,x in enumerate(arr):
        # IF i is even : 
        if i%2 == 0:
            # Intially size(Left) == size(Right)
            # Finally size(Left) == size(Right) - 1
            # So, u need to increase size of right by 1 
            if x < min(Left):
                val = Left.min_pop()  ## remove the current min
                Left.insert(x)     ## new min
                Right.insert(val)  ## moving to the right
            else:
                Right.insert(x)   ### keep the min in Left,  only change the right.
                
        else:
            if x > max(Right):
            val = Right.max_pop()
            Right.insert(x)
            Left.insert(val)   ####val added to left, right has new max == x
            else:
            Left.insert(x)

            
    #### Sliding window  based on position of X,           
        A[i1:i2]      and i1, i2 are moving....      

    Why left and right  ?  
    why not only  i1, i2 indexes ....
        We can only use index   i1, i2
        
        sometimes, there are problem with i1, i2 in sliding window....   A[i1:i2]  
        Inserting is log(n)
        --> total is n/log(n)      
        
        
        

    def getMedian():
        if len(Left) != len(Right):
            return Right[0]
        else:
            return (Right[0] + Left[0])/2

    The idea is to traverse array from left to right keeping two variables minVal and maxVal which represents the minimum and maximum product value till the ith index of the array. Now, if the ith element of the array is negative that means now the values of minVal and maxVal will be swapped as value of maxVal will become minimum by multiplying it with a negative number. Now, compare the minVal and maxVal. 
    The value of minVal and maxVal depends on the current index element or the product of the current index element and the previous minVal and maxVal respectively.
    Below is the implementation of above approach:

Count Inversions 
        Medium Accuracy: 39.43% Submissions: 100k+ Points: 4
        Given an array of integers. Find the Inversion Count in the array. 

        Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted.
        If array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0. 
        If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum. 
        
        ####  Not merge sort invresion
        Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.


    Example 1:
        Input: N = 5, arr[] = {2, 4, 1, 3, 5}
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 
        has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

    Example 2:
        Input: N = 5
        arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
        Output: 0
        Explanation: As the sequence is already 
        sorted so there is no inversion count.

    Example 3:
        Input: N = 3, arr[] = {10, 10, 10}
        Output: 0
        Explanation: As all the elements of array 
        are same, so there is no inversion count.

    Expected Time Complexity: O(NLogN).
    Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Longest Prefix Suffix 
        Medium Accuracy: 49.39% Submissions: 41665 Points: 4
        Given a string of characters, find the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.

        NOTE: Prefix and suffix can be overlapping but 
        they should not be equal to the entire string.

        Medium Accuracy: 42.59% Submissions: 48080 Points: 4
        Given two strings S and P. Find the smallest window in the string S consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string P. 
        Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index. 

        Example 1:

        Input:
        S = "timetopractice"
        P = "toc"
        Output: 
        toprac
        Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest
        substring in which "toc" can be found.
        Example 2:

        Input:
        S = "zoomlazapzo"
        P = "oza"
        Output:

        Method 1 ( Brute force solution ) 
                1- Generate all substrings of string1 ("this is a test string") 
                2- For each substring, check whether the substring contains all characters of string2 ("tist") 
                3- Finally, print the smallest substring containing all characters of string2.
        
        Method 2 ( Efficient Solution ) 

                First check if the length of the string is less than the length of the given pattern, if yes then "no such window can exist ".
                Store the occurrence of characters of the given pattern in a hash_pat[].
                we will be using two pointer technique basically
                Start matching the characters of pattern with the characters of string i.e. increment count if a character matches.
                Check if (count == length of pattern ) this means a window is found.
                If such a window found, try to minimize it by removing extra characters from the beginning of the current window.
                delete one character from first and again find this deleted key at right, once found apply step 5 .
                Update min_length.
                Print the minimum length window.

Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. 
        Substring of string S: S[ i . . . . j ] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(S). 
        Palindrome string: A string which reads the same backwards. 
        More formally, S is palindrome if reverse(S) = S. Incase of conflict, 
        return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).

8. Max sum in the configuration 
            Medium Accuracy: 49.48% Submissions: 51212 Points: 4
            Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i*A[i] where A[i] is the element at index i in the array. 
            The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.

        Example 1:
            Input:
            N = 4
            A[] = {8,3,1,2}
            Output: 29
            Explanation: Above the configuration
            possible by rotating elements are
            3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
            1 2 8 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+8*2+3*3 = 27
            2 8 3 1 here sum is 2*0+8*1+3*2+1*3 = 17
            8 3 1 2 here sum is 8*0+3*1+1*2+2*3 = 11
            Here the max sum is 29 
            Your Task:
            Your task is to complete the function max_sum which takes two arguments which is the array A [ ] 
            and its size and returns an integer value denoting the required max sum.

        Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
        Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

        Constraints:
        1<=N<=104
        1<=A[]<1000
        

        
        
        
        Method 3: The method discusses the solution using pivot in O(n) time. 
        The pivot method can only be used in the case of a sorted or a rotated sorted array. 
        For example: {1, 2, 3, 4} or {2, 3, 4, 1}, {3, 4, 1, 2} etc.


        Approach: Let's assume the case of a sorted array. 
        As we know for an array the maximum sum will be when the array is sorted in ascending order. 
        In case of a sorted rotated array, we can rotate the array to make it in ascending order. 
        So, in this case, the pivot element is needed to be found following which the maximum sum can be calculated.

        Algorithm: 
        Find the pivot of the array: if arr[i] > arr[(i+1)%n] then it is the pivot element. 
        (i+1)%n is used to check for the last and first element.
        After getting pivot the sum can be calculated by finding the difference with the pivot which will be the multiplier 
        and multiply it with the current element while calculating the sum
        Implementations:
        
        
        # Python3 program to find maximum sum of  all rotation of i*arr[i] using pivot. 

        # function definition 
        def maxSum(arr, n) :
            sum = 0
            pivot = findPivot(arr, n)

            # difference in pivot and index 
            # of last element of array 
            diff = n - 1 - pivot 
            for i in range(n) :
                sum1 = sum1 + ((i + diff) % n) * arr[i]; 
            return sum1
            
        
        # function to find pivot 
        def findPivot(arr, n) :
            for i in range(n) : 
                if(arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]) :
                    return i; 

        
        
        # Driver code 
        if __name__ == "__main__" :

            # rotated input array 
            arr = [8, 3, 1, 2] 
            n= len(arr) 
            
            max= maxSum(arr, n)
            print(max)

 partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.
        Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.

        Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
        Output: [9,7,8]
        Explanation:
        The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
        This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
        A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
        Output: [10]
        

        Constraints:

 21. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
        Medium Accuracy: 45.75% Submissions: 12262 Points: 4
        Given a string S, find the length of its longest substring that does not have any repeating characters.

    Example 1:
        Input:
        S = gee ksforgeeks
        Output: 7
        Explanation: The longest substring
        without repeated characters is "ksforge".
    
    
    Example 2:
        Input:
        S = abbcdb
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The longest substring is
        "bcd". Here "abcd" is not a substring
        of the given string.
        Your Task:
        Complete SubsequenceLength function that takes string s as input and returns the length of the longest substring that does not have any repeating characters.

    Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
    Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

    Constraints: 
    0<= N <= 10^5
    here, N = S.length

        2 pointer i1,i2  for substring
        condition :  c[i]  not in ddict
        keep the state.
    
    max1 =0 
    ddict = {}
    st = 0
    for i in range(0,n):
    
        ci = S[i]
    
        if ci not in ddict :    ### condition1 :  Unique character
            ddict[ci] = 1
            maxl = max(max1 , (i - st + 1))
            # continue  ### increase lenght
        else :
        ddict[ S[st] ] -= 1   ###  Decrement
        st   = st + 1
            i   = i - 1          ### why ? because next iteration increase the counter., need to keep the counter same.

A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:
        The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group

        consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
        For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
        Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.

        Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
        Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
        Explanation:
        The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group.
        The next 3 characters "def" form the second group.
        The last 3 characters "ghi" form the third group.
        Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
        Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
        Output: ["abc","def","ghi","jxx"]
        Explanation:
        Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups "abc", "def", and "ghi".
        For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
        Thus, the 4 groups formed are "abc", "def", "ghi", and "jxx".

            def divideString(self, s: str, k: int, fill: str) -> List[str]:

2104. Sum of Subarray Ranges
    https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-ranges/
    https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-ranges/discuss/1624416/Python3-stack
    
    You are given an integer array nums.
     The range of a subarray of nums is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the subarray.

    Return the sum of all subarray ranges of nums.
    A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,3]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
    [1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0 
    [2], range = 2 - 2 = 0
    [3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
    [1,2], range = 2 - 1 = 1
    [2,3], range = 3 - 2 = 1
    [1,2,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
    So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,3,3]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
    [1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0
    [3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
    [3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
    [1,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
    [3,3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
    [1,3,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
    So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.
    Example 3:

    Input: nums = [4,-2,-3,4,1]
    Output: 59
    Explanation: The sum of all subarray ranges of nums is 59.
    

    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
        
    
        
        
    #######  O(N**2)   
    class Solution:
        def subArrayRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            
            def fn(op): 
                """Return min sum (if given gt) or max sum (if given lt)."""
                ans = 0 
                stack = []
                for i in range(len(nums) + 1): 
                    while stack and (i == len(nums) or op(nums[stack[-1]], nums[i])): 
                        mid = stack.pop()
                        ii = stack[-1] if stack else -1 
                        ans += nums[mid] * (i - mid) * (mid - ii)
                    stack.append(i)
                return ans 
            
            return fn(lt) - fn(gt)    
        

    For those not understanding multiplication : i-mid * mid-i . Forget minima/maxima for a second and focus on why it's multiplied.

    We want to see the number of subarray's nums[mid] would be a part of.

    For the left side, it will be a part of subarray's with mid as the ending.
    For the right side, it will be a part of subarrays with mid as the beginning.
    Now total subarray's that can be formed is by the combination formula, for each subarray in left side, how many subarrays on the right side can it be combined with.
    i.e,
    each subarray on the left can pick every subarray on the right , leading to left*ri

          Medium Accuracy: 53.18% Submissions: 10804 Points: 4
          Given N non-negative integers a1,a2,....an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
          N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i,0).
          Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that it contains the most water.

    Example 1:
          Input:
          N = 4
          a[] = {1,5,4,3}
          Output: 6
          Explanation: 5 and 3 are distance 2 apart.
          So the size of the base = 2. Height of
          container = min(5, 3) = 3. So total area
          = 3 * 2 = 6.

    Example 2:
          Input:
          N = 5
          a[] = {3,1,2,4,5}

          Explanation: 5 and 3 are distance 4 apart.
          So the size of the base = 4. Height of

 ######################################################################################A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure.

      The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. 
      Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
      For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, 
      a character fill is used to complete the group.
      Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) 
      and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.

      Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, 
      return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
      Example 1:
          Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
          Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
          Explanation:
          The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group.
          The next 3 characters "def" form the second group.
          The last 3 characters "ghi" form the third group.
          Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
          Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".
      
      
      Example 2:
          Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
          Output: ["abc","def","ghi","jxx"]
          Explanation:
          Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups "abc", "def", and "ghi".
          For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
          Thus, the 4 groups formed are "abc", "def", "ghi", and "jxx".


      class Solution:
          def divideString(self, s: str, k: int, fill: str) -> List[str]:
              res = []
              wordk=-1 ;  ii = -1
              for x in s :

1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

    HOMEWORK 

        https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/solution/  
        Medium

        Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

        Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid 
        and return any valid string.

        Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

        It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
        It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
        It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
  

  Example 1:
      Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
      Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
      Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

  Example 2:
      Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
      Output: "ab(c)d"
      Example 3:

      Input: s = "))(("
      Output: ""
      Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
  

  Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 10**5
        s[i] is either'(' , ')', or lowercase English letter.

      for ch in word: 
        
        if ch == '(':

    ##### Solution 2
    Approach 2: Two Pass String Builder
  Intuition

  A key observation you might have made from the previous algorithm is that for all invalid ")", 
      we know immediately that they are invalid (they are the ones we were putting in the set).
      It is the "(" that we don't know about until the end (as they are what was left on the stack at the end). W
      e could be building up a string builder in that first loop that has all of the invalid ")" removed. This would be half the problem solved in the first loop, in O(n)O(n) time.
    
  class Solution:
      def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:

          def delete_invalid_closing(string, open_symbol, close_symbol):
              sb = []
              balance = 0
              for c in string:
                  if c == open_symbol:
                      balance += 1
      
                  if c == close_symbol:
                      if balance == 0:
                          continue
                      balance -= 1
                  sb.append(c)
              return "".join(sb)

          # Note that s[::-1] gets the reverse of s.
          s = delete_invalid_closing(s, "(", ")")
          s = delete_invalid_closing(s[::-1], ")", "(")
          return s[::-1]

92. Top K Frequent Words
   Medium
    Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.
    Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

 
    Example 1:
        Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
        Output: ["i","love"]
        Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
        Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

        
    Example 2:
        Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
        Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
        Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.


    Constraints:
        1 <= words.length <= 500
        1 <= words[i] <= 10
        words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
        k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]

39. Combination Sum
            Medium
            https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/solution/


            Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates
            where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
            The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. 
            Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
            It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.



        Example 1:
            Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
            Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
            
            Explanation:
            2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
            7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
            These are the only two combinations.

            
        Example 2:
            Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
            Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
            Example 3:

            Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
            Output: []
        

        Constraints:
            1 <= candidates.length <= 30
            1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
            All elements of candidates are distinct.

        Solution
        Overview
        This is one of the problems in the series of combination sum. They all can be solved with the same algorithm, i.e. backtracking.
        Before tackling this problem, we would   
        Algorithm

            As one can see, the above backtracking algorithm is unfolded as a DFS (Depth-First Search) tree traversal, which is often implemented with recursion.
            Here we define a recursive function of backtrack(remain, comb, start) (in Python), which populates the combinations, starting from the current combination (comb), the remaining sum to fulfill (remain) and the current cursor (start) to the list of candidates. Note that, the signature of the recursive function is slightly different in Java. But the idea remains the same.

1048. Longest String Chain
    https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/discuss/1213876/Python-3-solutions-LIS-DP-Top-down-DP-Bottom-up-DP-Clean-and-Concise
    https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/
        
    You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

    wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA
        without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

    For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
    A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

    Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

    

    Example 1:
          Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
          Output: 4
          Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
        
        
    Example 2:
          Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
          Output: 5
          Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].

        
    Example 3:
        Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
        ["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
    

    Constraints:
        1 <= words.length <= 1000
        1 <= words[i].length <= 16
        words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.

    ✔️ Solution 2: Top-Down DP

                        ans = max(ans, dp(predecessor) + 1)

          "abac" -> ".bac" and checking if it's inside Wordset

          we list all possible  (n-1) predecssor of 'abac'
            --> Equivalent to :

                  ans = max(ans, dp(predecessor) + 1)            
        
            Calculate the same for each predc  (ie N-2 pred of  predecior)

    ✔️ Solution 1: Longest Increasing Subsequence Idea
    Time: O(N^2 * L), where N <= 1000 is number of words, L <= 16 is length of each word.
    Space: O(N)

    Firstly, we sort words in increasing order by their length, to ensure length of the previous word no longer
    than length of the current word, it means len(words[j]) <= len(word[i]), where j < i.
    Let dp[i] be the longest increasing subsequence which ends at words[i].
    To check if word1 is a predecessor of word2, we need to check
    len(word1) + 1 must equal to len(word2).
    word1 must be a subsequence of word2.

23. Max Circular Subarray Sum 
      https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/discuss/1348545/Python-3-solutions-Clean-and-Concise-O(1)-Space
      Hard Accuracy: 45.16% Submissions: 48463 Points: 8
      Given an array arr[] of N integers arranged in a circular fashion. 
      Your task is to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum.

                            
    Example 1:
          Input:
          N = 7
          arr[] = {8,-8,9,-9,10,-11,12}
          Output:
          22
          Explanation:
          Starting from the last element
          of the array, i.e, 12, and 
          moving in a circular fashion, we 
          have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, 
          -9, 10, which gives maximum sum 
          as 22.

          
    Example 2:
          Input:
          N = 8
          arr[] = {10,-3,-4,7,6,5,-4,-1}
          Output:
          23
          Explanation: Sum of the circular 
          subarray with maximum sum is 23

          
    Your Task:
          The task is to complete the function circularSubarraySum() which returns a sum of the circular subarray with maximum sum.

          Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
          Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


    Constraints:
        1 <= N <= 106
        -106 <= Arr[i] <= 106
    
      
      Array parsing
        
        
        A[N-1  % N]
        A[ N  %N = 0 ]  = A[0]
        A[N+1 %N]  = A[1]


      standard Array :
          
          for i2 in range(0, N):
              
              while cur_total >= max_total and i1 < i1 :
                i1 = i1 + 1              
                cur_total = sum(A[i1:i2])                
                max_total = max(max_total, cur_total) 
                  
    neg. value ???
    minimu continous array 
      largest minimum value

    If only positive ---> whole array
    Indetify the largest negative array Continous.


    [5, 5, 5 ,5, 5] => The whole array 
    [5, 5, ,5, -5, 5]
                  
      [ 4,1, 4, -10, 1, -5, 20, -1 ]  --> 20,-1,4,1,4  
        WHY you take this approach , benfits of this approach.
      
      
  
        
    # Python program for maximum contiguous circular sum problem Standard Kadane's algorithm 
    ##  to find maximum subarray sum
    def kadane(a):
        Max = a[0]
        temp = Max
        for i in range(1,len(a)):
            temp += a[i]
            if temp < a[i]:
                temp = a[i]
            Max = max(Max,temp)
        return Max

      
    1) why we cnnot kadane direcrtly on max sum ??
        
        Because the problem is circular array, 
            you can make the % trick instead 
      
      
      2) why we can apply Kadane on the maximum negative ?
          still circular here too....Only no-circular array
        
          Why you dont need to this the % trick....
          
          Because he is finding both the min and max of the array (-ve and +ve) 
          and getting the solution from subtracting them. 
          
          use Kadane to find both min and max ???
            
            
          
      
    # The function returns maximum circular contiguous sum in a[]
    def maxCircularSum(a):

        n = len(a)

        # Case 1: get the maximum sum using standard kadane's
        # algorithm
        max_kadane = kadane(a)   #####  Max array

        # Case 2: Now find the maximum sum that includes elements.
        
        # You can do so by finding the maximum negative contiguoussum
        # convert a to -ve 'a' and run kadane's algo
        neg_a = [-1*x for x in a]
        max_neg_kadane = kadane(neg_a)   ### max negative. 

        
        # Max sum with corner elements will be:
        # array-sum - (-max subarray sum of inverted array)
        max_wrap = -(sum(neg_a)-max_neg_kadane)  
        ### sum_all_array - max_negative_subbrary_sum 
        ###  circular : max_wrap is related to the circula condition.
        
        
        

        # The maximum circular sum will be maximum of two sums
        res = max(max_wrap,max_kadane)
        return res if res != 0  else max_kadane

    # Driver function to test above function
    a = [11, 10, -20, 5, -3, -5, 8, -13, 10]
    print "Maximum circular sum is", maxCircularSum(a)

      [ 4,1, 4, -10, 1, -5, 20, -1 ]  --> 20,-1,4,1,4  

      [ -5, 20, -1,  4,1, 4, -10, 1, ]  --> 
      
            max negativ :  -10, 1,-5
            max kadane  :  20,-1,4,1,4    : never circular, why ?  Because Kadane apply says to [0, N], only straight array

                
            2 possibilities :
                1)  max array is NOT circular -->  max array  = Kadane
              
                2)  max arrat IS circular  --. Max array NOT kadane
                            BUT, Max negative is NOT circular :  (cannot have both circular )
                                  --> we apply kadane on Max Negative
                                          Max array = total array - Max Negative.
                        
                  3) merge both cases
                                Max(case1, case2, ....)
                  
                  We do not need TO know if max array is circular or NOT.
                    to solve the problem (ie implicit).
                    
                    
                  Should take few example (instead of writing )

                  

                        Why we can apply kadane
                        why we need to compute the negative max array.

209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum       Medium

            Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target,
                return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr]
                of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

        Example 1:
            Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
            Output: 2
            Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.


        Example 2:
            Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
            Output: 1


        Example 3:
            Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
            Output: 0
            
        Constraints:
            1 <= target <= 109
            1 <= nums.length <= 105
            1 <= nums[i] <= 105

                for right, n in enumerate(nums):
                    total += n   ##### Init with the max one (as we need to take the minimal)

                        left += 1    ### Decrement the left to make it smaller.

            ileft : decrement until the condition is ok, (we take minimal size)    
            
            just following the right
            
            left is GLOBAL (not local to the loop):
                left=0   --> right
            left --->  [] right
            
                Why left is global :
                
                    left =

                array have only +ve integers OK 
                        reassining left to 0 will make you go through the loop from the beginning 
                            We don't need that because we will always skip all numbers before previous left 
                                We are trying ot reach minimal length of the subarray 
                
                why this :  "we will always skip all numbers before previous left "
                    because :
                        while total >= starget :
                        
                        If we include left= [0 ... LeftCurrent] :
                            By definition of  while total >= starget  And array[i]>0 :
                                total[left_i] > starget is ALWAYS
                                condiiton was ALWAYS preserved.
                                
                            we do not need to iterate [0 ..LeftCurrent]     
                                
                            As soon condition is ok, we can keep global left.
                            
                    
                    Iterate on the Conditions.
                    
                    Continuous array is often O(N)  or O(N. Log N)
                    
                    
                    If number Negative >0

An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) 
        is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

        Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

        Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
        Output: true
        Example 2:

        Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
        Output: false
        Example 3:

        Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]
        Output: false
        

        Constraints:

        rect1.length == 4
        rect2.length == 4
        -109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109
        rec1 and rec2 represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and newColor. 

        You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

        To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, 
        plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color 
        as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with newColor.

        Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.



        Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
        Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
        Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
        Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.



        Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, newColor = 2
        Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
